We love hanging out with college students talking about our awesome savior Jesus.   Before serving here in central NY, we were on staff in Sevilla, Spain, and Kearney Nebraska.  Our life is an exciting adventure of faith.  We've got four kids who we really love a lot: Jack, Josiah, Titus and Ruby.  They  keep us wild and crazy.  Our family likes bikes, books and bean burritos from Taco Bell.</p>
