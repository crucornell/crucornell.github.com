<p>We&#8217;re all on a spiritual journey.  Whether you&#8217;re convinced and running hard after God, checking Him out but needing  more proof, or feeling stuck in a spiritual quagmire not knowing what to believe.  We&#8217;re all on the journey.</p>
<p>Campus Crusade for Christ is a community that is on the journey together.  We believe that there is a God who made us for relationship with Himself.  He&#8217;s not an aloof God who looks on from a distance, like a far off relative who you know is there but never really interact with.  He&#8217;s a God who says, &#8220;You will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart.  I will be found by you, declares the Lord.&#8221;  We believe that to know God means to know Jesus.  <a href="http://www.everystudent.com/features/faith.html">He is no ordinary man.</a> He is &#8220;God made flesh&#8221;, the &#8220;exact representation of God.&#8221;  And, he came so that we could have the life we were made for.  Life that&#8217;s found in a real life relationship with the God of the universe.</p>
<p>In Cru we love each other and the Cornell community.  Jesus demonstrated crazy love for people all throughout his life on earth.  The ultimate display taking place on a cross.  Having experienced that love, having accepted and been amazed by that love, we want others to know it too.  That&#8217;s why we love people, because He first loved us and showed us the way.</p>
<p>But enough talk.  The best way to get to know us is to come hang out with us.  Check out our <a href="http://cornellcru.com/real-life/" target="_self">large group</a> meeting on Friday nights.  Come to one of the <a href="http://cornellcru.com/news-and-events/" target="_self">events</a> we have scattered throughout the year.  Get involved with one of our <a href="http://cornellcru.com/community-groups/" target="_self">community groups.</a> It&#8217;s our hope that Cru will be a place where you can  journey with friends toward the God who made you for relationship with Himself.</p>
