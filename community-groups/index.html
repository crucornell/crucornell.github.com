<p>Campus Crusade for Christ is a community.  It&#8217;s also a pretty big community, which makes it almost impossible to know everyone very well.  Community groups are places to get to know a few people, really well.  They are places to talk about real life issues and to go deeper into each others lives.  They&#8217;re also places to ask questions, to wrestle with truths of the Bible and to grow in your faith.</p>
<p>Whether you are new to Cru, you&#8217;ve been hanging around waiting  for an opportunity, or you&#8217;re not even &#8220;<em>in&#8221;</em> Cru, there is a Community Group on your part of campus that would love to have you join.</p>
