<p>The Bible.</p>
<h3><em><strong>What is the Bible?</strong></em></h3>
<p>The  Bible is a collection of 66 books, written by over 40 different  authors  over a period of about 1,500 years.  It is categorized into Old  and New  Testaments, the Old Testament being written in ancient Hebrew  and the  New Testament being written in ancient Greek and Aramaic.  The  Old  Testament refers to the books written before the coming of Jesus to  the  earth in human form, and the New Testament refers to those written  after  this history-changing event.</p>
<p>There  are many different genres included in the Bible, such as  history, law,  poetry, wisdom literature, songs, prophecy, and letters.   These genres  speak to different facets of the character of God: his  justice and  mercy, his righteousness and grace, his holiness and  incarnation, his  wisdom and law, his beauty and majesty, his  faithfulness and patience,  his order and purpose, his love and passion,  his grandness and intimacy,  and much more.  If God is indeed a  personal creator who is greater than  all his creation, then it is to be  expected that no one genre or  writing style could embody completely  who he is.</p>
<p>However,  though the Bible is written by many authors and includes  different  genres of literature, there is an overarching narrative  throughout the  entirety of it: the God's faithful patience, persistent  rescue,  and sacrificial redemption of his beloved humankind in spite of  (and  necessitated by) their rebellion and apathy.  As a whole, the  Bible is  an account of the fall of man, the consequences of sin, the  intervention  of God in human history to redeem the brokenness, and the  foretastes of  the new life offered in Jesus.</p>
<h3><em><strong>Why should I read the Bible? </strong></em></h3>
<p>We  believe that the Bible is the inspired word of God, meaning that,   unlike typical literature regarding wisdom and morality, it is living   and active, as if God were speaking to us and singing over us afresh each day. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkNa6tLWrqk" target="_blank">And though it is primarily about God and his glory</a>,   it also helps us to know how to live in the life that Jesus offers,  and  gives freely, to us.  Paul, one of the apostles and writers of the  Bible, wrote that the Bible is “profitable for teaching, for reproof,   for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God   may be competent, equipped for every good work” (2 Timothy 3:16-17).    This means that the bible lets us know the way in which God would have   us live, in relationship to him and to each other, and to be prepared   for the work that he calls us to do.</p>
<h3><em><strong>Where should I start with?</strong></em></h3>
<p>If  it is your first time reading the Bible, I would recommend that  you  start by reading the 4 Gospels, i.e. the four accounts of the life,   ministry, and death of Jesus.  These are the first four books of the  New  Testament &#8211; Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.  And if you had to  choose  which of the 4 Gospels to read first, I would recommend John,  because I  have found that John's writing style, while it is often  cryptic, lays  out plainly Jesus' divinity and what Jesus says about  himself.</p>
<p>The  word “gospel” means "good news," that is the good news that  Jesus came  to save us from spiritual death and alienation from God by  his perfect  life and sacrifice in our place.  The four gospels are each  like short  biographies that give us a glimpse into the life of  history's most  influential person, Jesus.  It tells of his interactions  with people  around him, his teachings, his miracles, his emotions, his  humanity and  divinity, his life and death.  Because Jesus, the Son of  God, is the  primary protagonist of the entire bible and because all of  Scripture  points to him, the gospels (and then the rest of the New  Testament)  would be a great place to start your reading of the Bible.</p>
<h3><em><strong>How long does it take to read the whole bible? (And how do you read it?)</strong></em></h3>
<p>It  depends.  Because the Bible is unlike any other book, reading  through  it will also be different.  It will also depend on whether you   want to have a cursory or in-depth reading, both of which  have their  benefits: a cursory reading will give you a broad  understanding of  God's work throughout history for the benefit of his  people and a basic  timeline of God's plan for redemption, while an  in-depth reading will  give you a better understanding of the details and  implications of that  work.  Because the Bible is such a rich book with  so many relevant  topics and truths, having both a cursory and an  in-depth reading of the  Bible would probably be valuable.</p>
<p>However  you decide to read the Bible, it would be best to spend some  reflecting  and meditating on what is being told or taught.  Some  things that you  can ponder while reading are: "Why does the author say  this?"; "What  does this say about God's character?"'; "How does this  fit into the  bible narrative of creation, fall, redemption, and  restoration?"; "What  implications does this have for my life?"  Such  introspective and  contemplative questions can give you a deeper and  richer understanding  of, and desire for, the word of God.</p>
