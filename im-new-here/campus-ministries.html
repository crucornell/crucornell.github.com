<p>Cornell is big.  It&#8217;s the biggest Ivy League school with something like <a href="http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=15&amp;type=qfs&amp;skey=cornell" target="_blank">14,000 students</a> who call Ithaca home for 9 months out of the year.  If Cru had 20,000 students showing up each week that would be amazing.  Amazing&#8230; and totally overwhelming!  Thankfully, there are other Christian groups on campus that love Jesus and are passionate about telling others about Him.  Here are a few of them:</p>
