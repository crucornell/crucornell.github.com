title: Fellowship

<p>Fellowship  is a cool old word that basically means friendship.   Fellowship is  meaningful friendship between people who really know and  care for each  other and who are actually connected with one another  emotionally,  socially and even spiritually.</p>
<p>College is a cool time of life where you can have a lot of fun and  make some truly great friends.  You  are here to get an education for  sure, but the highlight is the  relationships right?  (And actually,  come to think of it - wasn't that  also the best thing about high school?    I mean I don't see anybody  posting pictures on face book of their  scantron sheets!)  Why is that?   Why is it that all of us yearn for  "good friends" to go with our "good  times?"</p>
<p>The  Bible answers by explaining that we were created by a loving and   personal God who made us to exist in relationships.  God made us in  his  image, and he literally designed us to live life connected to him  and to  other people.  In the book of Genesis (the first book of the  Bible)  God even says plainly "it is not good for man to be alone."  So   fellowship isn't  just something we want, it's something that we need!</p>
<p>Jesus  is  the one who makes great fellowship possible.   His death  on the  cross dealt with our sin.  Sin is what separates us from God,  and sin is  what devastates our relationships with other people.   Sin  is what  convinces us that we can make it on our own, but that's a lie!   Only  thru Jesus can we live in truth and experience life giving  community the  way that God intended us to.</p>
<p>Cru  is a place of fellowship.  It's place for you to plug in and get   connected with God and with people.  Cru is a great place for you to   make lasting friendships that help you to grow closer to God.  It's a   place where you can come together with others to experience the grace of   the Gospel and walk in the refreshing light of truth.  Cru is also a   place where you can link up with others to serve and love the world the   way Christ has called us to.</p>
<p>The best way to get plugged in is to <a href="http://cornellcru.com/community-groups/" target="_self">join one of our community groups.</a></p>
<p>But  Cru is only part of the package.  We believe it is <a href="http://cornellcru.com/im-new-here/find-a-church.html">essential for  students to be involved in a local church.</a> There are a number of good  ones here and town.</p>
