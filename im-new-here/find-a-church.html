<p>College is such a unique time of life and being part of a Christian student group like Cru can be an awesome part of that time.  But it goes beyond that.  Long after you&#8217;ve left the these hallowed halls it&#8217;s our hope that you&#8217;ve grown closer to Jesus than you were the day you graduated.  How&#8217;s that going to happen?  The Church.  Church isn&#8217;t about a building, it&#8217;s about people who are seeking God, growing in their faith, and encouraging others to do the same.  It&#8217;s God&#8217;s means for you to receive both love and truth, and to know Him better.  Cru is a four (or more) year deal, but being part of a church should last a lifetime.  So why not get plugged into one now?</p>
<p>All over the Ithaca area there are Solid, Christ-centered, Bible teaching churches.  A lot of them you can walk to. Others have shuttles that will pick you up at a few locations around campus.  And some even provide breakfast.  So, all you have to do is wake up and go&#8230;</p>
