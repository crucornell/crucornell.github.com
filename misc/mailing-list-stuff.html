<p>Cornell Campus Crusade for Christ makes use of Cornell&#8217;s CIT e-list service (commonly but mistakenly called a &#8220;listserv&#8221;, which is the trademark of a particular service that Cornell doesn&#8217;t use) to mass-email anybody who wants to get Cru&#8217;s updates.</p>
<p>The CIT website explains <a href="http://www2.cit.cornell.edu/computer/elist/lyris/join.html">how to join</a> and <a href="http://www2.cit.cornell.edu/computer/elist/lyris/leave.html">how to leave</a> an e-list in generic terms, but since lots of people have trouble with this, we&#8217;ll make it very simple and specific to Cru here:</p>
<p><strong>To JOIN our mailing list:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong> </strong>Send an email with <strong>no subject</strong> to <strong><a href="mailto:crusade-l-request@cornell.edu">crusade-l-request@cornell.edu</a></strong> with <strong>only the word &#8220;join&#8221; in the body of the email</strong> (don&#8217;t include the &#8220;quotes&#8221;) <strong>from the email address you want to be subscribed.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>To LEAVE our mailing list:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong> </strong>Send an email with <strong>no subject</strong> to <strong><a href="mailto:crusade-l-request@cornell.edu">crusade-l-request@cornell.edu</a></strong> with <strong>only the word &#8220;leave&#8221; in the body of the email</strong> (don&#8217;t include the &#8220;quotes&#8221;) <strong>from the email address you want to be unsubscribed.</strong></p></blockquote>
