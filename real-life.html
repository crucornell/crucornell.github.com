<p>Picture this&#8230;  The week you just went through could easily be called your hardest while at Cornell.  It&#8217;s Friday afternoon now and you&#8217;ve just finished your problem set for Principles of Nanomolecular Transmogrification of Jargon with Wine,  which means you can finally take a break from the books and officially start the weekend.  Now is the time to unplug, hang with some friends, have fun, maybe still learn something (you are a Cornell student!), and be yourself.  You want Real Life.</p>
<p><strong>Real Life is what we call the weekly large group meeting of Campus Crusade for Christ. </strong> <strong></strong> It&#8217;s one place where we connect with each other to learn more about (and grow closer to) God.  Usually we start out with some hanging out, followed by an emcee who gets the night under way.  After that, the band leads out with some worship music.  (From southern gospel to old timey hymns, from David Crowder to John Newton.  The music is varied, reverent and rockin.)</p>
<p>After the band steps down, a <a href="/about-us/cru-staff/">Cru Staff person</a> steps up and shares a few thoughts from the Bible on Jesus, Life, God, Jesus, Culture, Relationships, Jesus&#8230;you name it. This is the part that makes you think.</p>
<p>Then when it&#8217;s done, we mill around and meet people. And chill. You can expect over 100 people to be there each Friday.  Amongst our highest values for the night is the idea that while truth is something we seek outside of ourselves (we don&#8217;t manufacture it), your <em>journey</em> is your own. We&#8217;re here to be help along the way.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s every Friday night at 7:30pm in HEC Auditorium ( which is on the first floor of Goldwin Smith Hall</strong>.) We&#8217;d love to have you, and it&#8217;s a great time.  So come!</p>
