It&#8217;s at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=203+wyckoff+ave,+ithaca,+ny&amp;sll=42.453585,-76.485726&amp;sspn=0.011906,0.019011&amp;g=thurston+ave,+ithaca,+ny&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=203+Wyckoff+Ave,+Ithaca,+Tompkins,+New+York+14850&amp;ll=42.453849,-76.48157&amp;spn=0.002976,0.006797&amp;t=h&amp;z=18">203 Wyckoff Ave.</a>, which is really close to Risley and just a short walk from Balch, as you can see from the map. Some <a href="http://cornellcru.com/community-groups">Community Groups</a> are held at the Mott House, as well as parties and other Christian get-togethers.</p>
<p>The Mott house is not <em>only</em> a host to Cru events, but is in fact open to the whole Christian community at Cornell. Although there are people living there, they welcome godly intrusions into their lives and simply ask that you clean up after yourself.</p>
